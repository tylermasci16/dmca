Dear Github,  
    I'm [private], a [private] of BUPT. It's nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.  
    I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
    I created a repository called "integrate-service" two years ago, which was a middle tier project to prepare resources and publish them to kinds of endpoints, such as website. The problem is that the repository contains system configuration information of out lab's machine, thus existing huge security threat. Later found that after I deleted the repository, the user named AppSecAI-TEST completely forked oky entire repository, and it still exists.  
    The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about my forked repository:  
https://github.com/AppSecAI-TEST/integrate-service
    
    Since "integrate-service" contains our lab's important source code, docs and system configuration information, belonging to our lab's internal data assets, so I hope Github as soon as possible to help me completely remove AppSecAI-TEST/integrate-service and thank you very much!  
    The following is my contact information:  
real name: [private]
